    The function ``__slice_index_list_by_class(...)``, separates the indices of the lines according
    to the output class, to loop through the sample array, only in positions where the output is the
    class being trained.

    Parameters:
        classes (``list or npt.NDArray``): list with unique classes.
        y (``npt.NDArray``): Receives a ``y``[``N sample``] array with the output classes of the 
                ``X`` sample array.

    returns:
        dict: A dictionary with the list of array positions(``y``), with the classes as key.
