class Base:
    """
    The base class contains functions that are used by more than one class in the package, and
    therefore are considered essential for the overall functioning of the system.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    metric (``str``): Way to calculate the distance between the detector and the sample:

        * ``'Euclidean'`` ➜ The calculation of the distance is given by the expression: \
            √( (x₁ – x₂)² + (y₁ – y₂)² + ... + (yn – yn)²).
        * ``'minkowski'`` ➜ The calculation of the distance is given by the expression: \
            ( |X₁ – Y₁|p + |X₂ – Y₂|p + ... + |Xn – Yn|p) ¹/ₚ.
        * ``'manhattan'`` ➜ The calculation of the distance is given by the expression: \
            ( |x₁ – x₂| + |y₁ – y₂| + ... + |yn – yn|) .


    p (``float``): This parameter stores the value of ``p`` used in the Minkowski distance.\
        The default is ``2``, which represents normalized Euclidean distance. Different \
        values of p lead to different variants of the [Minkowski Distance][1].
