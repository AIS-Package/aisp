# BaseNSA class

The ``_Base`` class contains utility functions with the ``protected`` modifier that can be inherited by various classes for ease of use. It includes functions for distance calculation, data separation to improve training and prediction efficiency, accuracy measurement and other functions.

## Functions


## Protected Functions:

---

### Function _distance(...):

```python
def _distance(self, u: npt.NDArray, v: npt.NDArray)
```

Function to calculate the distance between two points by the chosen ``metric``.

**Parameters**:
* ***u*** (``npt.NDArray``): Coordinates of the first point.
* ***v*** (``npt.NDArray``): Coordinates of the second point.

**returns**:
* Distance (``double``) between the two points.

---

### Function _check_and_raise_exceptions_fit(...):
```python
def _check_and_raise_exceptions_fit(self, X: npt.NDArray = None, y: npt.NDArray = None, _class_: Literal['RNSA', 'BNSA'] = 'RNSA')
```
Function responsible for verifying fit function parameters and throwing exceptions if the verification is not successful.

**Parameters**:
* ***X*** (``npt.NDArray``): Training array, containing the samples and their characteristics, [``N samples`` (rows)][``N features`` (columns)].
* ***y*** (``npt.NDArray``): Array of target classes of ``X`` with [``N samples`` (lines)].
* ***_class_*** (Literal[RNSA, BNSA], optional): Current class. Defaults to 'RNSA'.
