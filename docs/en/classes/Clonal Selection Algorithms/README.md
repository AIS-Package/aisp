# Clonal Selection Algorithm.

Clonal Selection Algorithms are inspired by the process of antibody proliferation upon detecting an antigen, during which
the generated antibodies undergo mutations in an attempt to enhance pathogen recognition.

## classes

1. **[Cell](Cell.md)**
> Represents a memory B-cell, responsible for storing and recognizing previously encountered patterns.
2. **[Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS)](AIRS.md)**
> The AIRS class aims to perform classification using metaphors of selection and clonal expansion.
> This implementation is inspired by AIRS2, a simplified version of the original AIRS algorithm.
> Introducing adaptations to handle continuous and binary datasets.
