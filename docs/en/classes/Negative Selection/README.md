# Negative selection

**Negative selection** is the process in which the immune system maturates T-cells, also known as T-lymphocytes, which make them capable of detecting non-self. Thus, the Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) uses hyperspheres symbolizing the detectors in an N-dimensional data space. [[1]](#1)

## classes

1. **[Binary version:](BNSA.md)**
> The binary algorithm adapted for multiple classes in this project is based on the version proposed by [Forrest et al. (1994)](#2), originally developed for computer security.

2. **[Real-Valued version:](RNSA.md)**
>This algorithm has two different versions: one based on the canonical version [[1]](#1) and another with variable radius detectors [[3]](#3). Both are adapted to work with multiple classes and have methods for predicting data present in the non-self region of all detectors and classes.
