# BNSA (Binary Negative Selection Algorithm)

This class extends the [**Base**](../../advanced-guides/Base%20Classes%20Reference/NegativeSelection.md) class.

## Constructor RNSA:

The ``BNSA`` (Binary Negative Selection Algorithm) class has the purpose of classifying and identifying anomalies through the self and not self methods.

**Attributes:**

* *N* (``int``): Number of detectors. Defaults to ``100``.
* *aff_thresh* (``float``): The variable represents the percentage of dissimilarity between the T cell and the own samples. The default value is 10% (0.1), while a value of 1.0 represents 100% dissimilarity.
* *max_discards* (``int``): This parameter indicates the maximum number of detector discards in sequence, which aims to avoid a
possible infinite loop if a radius is defined that it is not possible to generate non-self detectors. Defaults to ``100``.
* *seed* (``int``): Seed for the random generation of values in the detectors. Defaults to ``None``.
* no_label_sample_selection (``str``): Method for selecting labels for samples designated as non-members by all non-member detectors. **Available method types:**
    - (``max_average_difference``): Selects the class with the highest average difference among the detectors.
    - (``max_nearest_difference``): Selects the class with the highest difference between the nearest and farthest detector from the sample.

**Other variables initiated:**

* *detectors* (``dict``): This variable stores a list of detectors by class.

* *classes* (``npt.NDArray``): list of output classes.



### Function fit(...)

The ``fit(...)`` function generates the detectors for non-fits with respect to the samples:

```python
def fit(self, X: npt.NDArray, y: npt.NDArray):
```

In it, training is performed according to ``X`` and ``y``, using the negative selection method(``NegativeSelect``).

**The input parameters are:** 
* ``X``: array with the characteristics of the samples with **N** samples (rows) and **N** characteristics (columns). 

* ``y``: array with the output classes arranged in **N** samples that are related to ``X``.

* ``verbose``: boolean with default value ``True``, determines if the feedback from the detector generation will be printed.

**Raises**
* ``TypeError``: If X or y are not ndarrays or have incompatible shapes.
* ``MaxDiscardsReachedError``: The maximum number of detector discards was reached during
  maturation. Check the defined radius value and consider reducing it.


*Returns the instance of the class.*

### Function predict(...)

The ``predict(...)`` function performs class prediction using the generated detectors:

```python
def predict(self, X: npt.NDArray) -> npt.NDArray:
```

**The input parameter is:** 
* ``X``: array with the characteristics for the prediction, with **N** samples (Rows) and **N** columns.

**Raises:** 
* ``TypeError``: If X is not an ndarray or list.
* ``FeatureDimensionMismatch``: If the number of features in X does not match the expected number.
* ``ValueError``: X contains values that are not composed only of 0 and 1.

**Returns:** 
* ``C``: prediction array, with the output classes for the given characteristics.
* ``None``: if there are no detectors.

---

### Function score(...):

The function ``score(...)`` calculates the accuracy of the trained model by making predictions and computing accuracy.

```python
def score(self, X: npt.NDArray, y: list) -> float:
```

It returns the accuracy as a float type.

## Private Methods

---

### Function __assign_class_to_non_self_sample(...):

This function determines the class of a sample when all detectors classify it as "non-self". Classification is performed using the ``max_average_difference`` and ``max_nearest_difference`` methods.

```python
def __assign_class_to_non_self_sample(self, line, c) -> npt.NDArray:
```
**The input parameter is:** 

* ***line*** (``list``): Sample to be classified.
* ***c*** (``npt.NDArray``): List of predictions to be updated with the new classification.

**Returns:** 

``npt.NDArray``: The list of predictions `c` updated with the class assigned to the sample.
