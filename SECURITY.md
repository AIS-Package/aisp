## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Do not** open a public issue.  
- Report **privately** — go to GitHub: [**Security → Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/AIS-Package/aisp/security/advisories/new)

We will evaluate the report as quickly as possible, and any required fix will be given top priority for timely resolution.
